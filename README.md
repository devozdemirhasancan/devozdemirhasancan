### Hey there! 👋

I'm Hasan Can, a **full + full stack developer** who loves building awesome things! 🚀

- 🖥️ I **code** (sometimes like a wizard, sometimes like a monkey 🐒)
- 🍕 I **eat** (because fuel is important)
- 🎉 I **have fun** (code + caffeine = chaos!)
- 🤦 I **regret** (usually after deploys)

### 🔧 What I Do
- Developing from **embedded systems** to **web applications** 🏗️
- Working with **AI, software, and hardware** 🤖💾
- Passionate about **scalability, system architecture, and cutting-edge tech**

🔥 Fun Fact: Sometimes, I refactor code just to feel something. 😅
